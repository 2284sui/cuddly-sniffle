### Summary:
Simulation of state-of-the-art Cloud distributed services

### Description
This master thesis project is within the context of a research collaboration on datacenter computing between our group and [SAP](sap.com)'s Innovation Office for Global Cloud Services. The aim of the collaboration is to research, develop and evaluate innovative and efficient distributed services for SAP datacenters/generic datacenters for cloud applications.

The overall project covers serveral aspects of distributed systems such as hardware infrastrucure, network protocol design, operating system development, distributed algorithm design. <br> 
The work in this thesis will focus on carry on the development of a network simulation of such systems in order to obtain a "digital-twin" of one the current physical prototypes.  

- Technolgies involved: OMNet++, C++
