I'm a full professor at USI where I lead the Software Systems (SWYSTEMS) group. SWYSTEMS is part of USI's Computer Systems Institute, of which I am a founding member. Prior to that I was a regular faculty member at Purdue University (2005 - 2016) and TU Darmstadt (2014 - 2017). I have also been a visiting faculty member at MIT (2012/2013). I had the privilege to serve as program chair of ACM OOPSLA'15, and currently am serving as associate editor for IEEE TSE. Throughout the years I had the pleasure to collaborate with, and receive support from, several corporate partners including Cisco, Facebook, Google, HP, IBM, NetApp, and SAP. I am currently also serving as a vice-dean for the faculty of informatics.
