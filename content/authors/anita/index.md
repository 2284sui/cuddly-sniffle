Anita joined SWYSTEMS research group in February 2022, after completing MSc in Informatics at USI. In her previous life Anita was an assistant professor in mathematics at the University of Ljubljana and holds a PhD in algebraic geometry from the University of Warwick.

Anita is interested in quantum information theory. Currently she is working on quantum networks; her research is ranging from developing language and logic for dealing with and reasoning about quantum networks, to testing quantum applications on quantum network simulators. Anitaâ€™s overriding ambition is to make a significant contribution towards the development of Quantum Internet.
